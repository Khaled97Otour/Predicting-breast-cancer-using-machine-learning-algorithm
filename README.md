# Predicting-breast-cancer-using-machine-learning-algorithm

# Breast Cancer prediction:
I downliad the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset

Objective:
- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (We use the only the feature_mean for our model).
- Build classification models to predict whether the cancer type is Malignant or Benign.
- Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.


Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenge against its detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous, labeled 1) or benign(non-cancerous, labeled 0).

# results:
- The KNN model gave us the best results
- Grid search did not help to improve the results from our decision tree
